# Excel Bike Sales Project
In this project we used Excel to analyze the customers of bikes to determine where the primary sales effort is best directed. 

## Tools and technologies
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, data exploration and creation of final dashboard

## Project Objectives
- Identify primary customers of bikes
- Provide actionable insights to drive marketing strategies

## Data Sources
- [Bike Buyers Dataset](bike_buyers_dataset.xlsx)

## Analysis steps
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed duplicates
  - Replaced single letter values with full words
  - Removed decimals
  - Made age brackets
- **Data Exploration**:
  -  Made a clustered column chart based on gender, income and whether or not they purchased a bike
  -  Made a line chart based on commute distance and number of bikes bought
  -  Made a line chart based on age bracket and number of bikes bought
  -  Made a dashboard with each chart interconnected with slicers based on marital status, region and education

## Key findings
- Higher income means higher likelihood of buying a bike
- The majority of customers are between 31-55 years old
- Most customers have a commute of less than a mile
